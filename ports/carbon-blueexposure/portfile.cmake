  # Both Android fixes live in the fork's source now (ccpshanghai/blueexposure#1) instead of in
  # PATCHES here: `long` and `int64_t` are the same type under bionic on LP64, which three traits
  # specialisations did not expect, and three interfaces blue dynamic_casts to across shared
  # objects needed key functions, because the NDK's libc++abi compares type_info by address. The
  # second is ABI-shaped -- it adds a virtual -- which is precisely why it should not be a
  # downstream patch: a consumer could otherwise build unpatched source against a patched header.
